1. Report your IP addresses using the ifconfig command in *NIX or the ipconfig command in Windows. 
   Identify the addresses that are IPv6.
   * Done, not reporting the addresses for safety.
2. Report the name of the computer on which you are working by using the hostname command.
   * Done, not reporting the addresses for safety.
3. Can you find the IP address of any of your directly connected routers?
   * Yes, used the command "traceroute 8.8.8.8" (Google's address) to find it - first IP listed.
4. Use Internet search to try and discover what happened to IPv5?
   * Had limited space (same of IPv4 which already had concerns), desgined specifically
     for connection-oriented streaming (not as a replacement of IPv4, not developed for
     a standard internet protocol, just an experiment), and IPv6 was being developed 
     to address the concerns of IPv4 - 128 bits instead of 32 which better supports
     multicasting, increases # of IP addresses, more efficient routing, and better
     built-in security. 
5. Write the following IPv6 address using as few characters as possible: 
   * 2345:0000:0000:A432:0000:0000:0000:0023 -> 2345::A432:::23
6. Can you think of a real-life example of communication that does not fit the client-server
   model?
   * Talking to people face to face
7. To how many different kinds of networks is your home connected? How many support two-way transport?
   * "ifconfig" command shows this.
8. IP is a best-effort protocol, requiring that information be broken down into datagrams,
   which may be lost, duplicated, or reordered. TCP hides all of this, providing a reliable 
   service that takes and delivers an unbroken stream of bytes. How might you go about providing 
   TCP service on top of IP? Why would anybody use UDP when TCP is available?
   Use UDP when you willing to sacrifice reliability for speed.
